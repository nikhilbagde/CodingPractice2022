    /** Explanation
     * The algorithm taught in grade-school for decimal multiplication does not use
     * repeated additionâit uses shift and add to achieve a much better time complexity.
     * We can do the same with binary numbersâto multiply x and y we initialize the result
     * to 0 and iterate through the bits of x,adding 2ky to the result if the fcth bit of x is 1.
     * The value 2ky can be computed by left-shifting y by k. Since we cannot use add
     * directly, we must implement it. We apply the grade-school algorithm for addition to
     * the binary case, i.e., compute the sum bit-by-bit, and "rippling" the carry along.
     * As an example, we show how to multiply 13 = (1101)2 and 9 = (1001)2 using the
     * algorithm described above. In the first iteration, since the LSB of 13 is 1, we set the
     * result to (1001)2. The second bit of (1101)2 is 0, so we move on to the third bit.
     *
     * bit is 1, so we shift (1001)2 to the left by 2 to obtain (100100)2/ which we add to (1001)2
     * to get (101101)2. The fourth and final bit of (1101)2 is 1, so we shift (1001)2 to the left
     * by 3 to obtain (1001000)2, which we add to (101101)2 to get (1110101)2 = 117.
     * Each addition is itself performed bit-by-bit. For example, when adding (101101)2
     * and (1001000)2, the LSB of the result is 1 (since exactly one of the two LSBs of the
     * operands is 1). The next bit is 0 (since both the next bits of the operands are 0). The
     * next bit is 1 (since exactly one of the next bits of the operands is 1). The next bit is
     * 0 (since both the next bits of the operands are 1). We also "carry" a 1 to the next
     * position. The next bit is1(since the carry-in is1and both the next bits of the operands
     * are 0). The remaining bits are assigned similarly.
