 * Paint Fill: Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs.
 * That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color,
 * fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.
 * Hints:
 * #364,
 * #382
