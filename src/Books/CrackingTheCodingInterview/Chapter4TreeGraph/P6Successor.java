 * Successor: Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a
 * binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.
 * Hints:
 * #79, - Think how inOrder traversal work and reverse engineer it.
 * #91  - Successor of node is leftMost node of its right subTree, what if right subtree is null
