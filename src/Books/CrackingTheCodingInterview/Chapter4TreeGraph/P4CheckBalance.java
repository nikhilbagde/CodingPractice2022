/**
 * Created by Nikhil on 2/15/2017 12:45 AM.
 * Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced.
 * For the purposes of  this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree
 * such that the heights of the two subtrees of any  node never differ by more than one.
 * Hints:
 * #21,  - Think about condition of balance tree, can you check it for single node, and then for every node?
 * #33, - Brute force, if you are computing height for every level it would be inefficient.
 * #49, - What if we modify node class to store height of its subTree
 * #105, - You don't need to have field in Node class, instead can you try recursively to calculate height of subtree and
 * also if its balanced and try returning two values?
 * #124 - Instead you can only have checkHeightBalance function to compute both and have integer value as result.
