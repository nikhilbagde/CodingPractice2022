 * 2.8 Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list,
 * PAGE 95
 * implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
 * DEFINITION :
 *  Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node,
 *  so as to make a loop in the linked list.
 *  EXAMPLE
 *  Input: A -> B -> C - > D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
 *  Output: C
 *  Hints:  #50, = Actually two part of problem, 1. Detect if there is a loop 2. Find where loop starts.
 *          #69, = TO Detect loop, try runner method, where out of two pointers one pointer move fast.
 *          #83, = One pointer move fast, both pointers will collide | They land at same location at same time | what is this location ? where they collide ?
 *          #90  = Where two pointers start ?
 *          1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->?
 *          lets assume ? points to 1.  they meet at 1. after 9 iterations. 1 full iteration
 *          assume ? point to 2.        they meet ar 2 after 1 full iteration again.
 *          assume ? points to 3
 * Solution: 223
