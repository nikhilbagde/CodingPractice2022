 * Random Node: You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to
 * insert, find, and delete, has a method getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the tree.
 * All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.
 * Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode,
 * and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
 * Hints:
 * #42,
