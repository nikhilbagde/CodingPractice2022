/**
 * Created by Nikhil on 2/13/2017 7:34 PM.
 * When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer,
 * the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In a new kind of PDF viewer,
 * the selection of each word is independent of the other words;
 * this means that each rectangular selection area forms independently around each highlighted word.
 * For example: PDF-highighting.png
 * In this type of PDF viewer, the width of the rectangular selection area is equal to the number of letters
 * in the word times the width of a letter, and the height is the maximum height of any letter in the word.
 * Consider a word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters, where each letter is  wide.
 * Given the height of each letter in millimeters (), find the total area that will be highlighted by blue rectangle in
 * when the given word is selected in our new PDF viewer.
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective heights of each consecutive lowercase
 * English letter (i.e., ).
 * The second line contains a single word, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters.
 * Constraints
 * where  is an English lowercase letter.  Word contains no more than  letters.
 * Output Format
 * Print a single integer denoting the area of highlighted rectangle when the given word is selected.
 * The unit of measurement for this is square millimeters (), but you must only print the integer.
