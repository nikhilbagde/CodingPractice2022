 * Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1,
 * with any of these numbers appearing any number of times.
 * Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
 * For example, let n be 7 and array be {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6}, the answer should be 1, 3 and 6.
