 * Two very tall apartments are located in a residential area.Many television cables are connecting the apartments . Each cable connects a window on the first apartment to a window on the second apartment.
 * Lavkush is a guy living in that area.Lavkush looks the apartments from the side,so that one of the apartment is to the left and one is to the right.The windows on the left apartments are seen as points on its right wall,and the windows on the right apartment are seen as points on its left wall. Cables are the straight lines connecting a window on the left apartment to a window on the right apartment.
 * Lavkush notices that no two cables share an endpoint (in other words, there’s at most one cable going out of each window).However, some of the cables intersect midway.He also notices that exactly two cables meet at each intersection point.
 * image
 * On the above picture, the intersection points are the black circles, while the windows are the white circles. Help Lavkush by counting the number of intersection points .4
 * Input Format
 * The first line of the input gives an integer N, denoting the number of cables you see. The next N lines each describe one cable with two integers Ai and Bi. These describe the windows that this cable connects: Ai is the height of the window on the left apartment, and Bi is the height of the window on the right apartment.
 * Constraints
 * 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
 * 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 104
 * 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 104
 * Within each test case, all Ai are different. Within each test case, all Bi are different. No three cables intersect at the same point.
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, output one line containing y, where y is the number of intersection points you see.
