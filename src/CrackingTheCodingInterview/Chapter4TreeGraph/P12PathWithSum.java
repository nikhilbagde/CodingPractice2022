 * Created by Nikhil on 2/15/2017 1:10 AM.
 * Paths with Sum: You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which
 * might be positive or negative).
 * Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value.
 * The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
 * (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
 * Hints:
 * #6,
 * #14,
 * #52,
 * #68,
 * #77,
 * #87,
 * #94,
 * #103,
 * #108,
 * #115
